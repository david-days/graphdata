.PP
Clear out the graph's underlying structures, and null out the memory\&. All underlying graph structures will be cleared and the associated memory to the structures freed\&.

.RS 4
\fIg\fP Graph to be cleared

.SS "struct \fBgraphops_t\fP * getOperations (struct \fBgraph_t\fP * g)"

.PP
Create and fill the graphOps_t structure that handles basic operations for the graph\&. Using the \fBgraph_t\fP implementation pass, this function creates a \fBgraphops_t\fP structure necessary to handle basic functions for the given graph\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIg\fP Graph structure being used 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
Pointer to a new \fBgraphops_t\fP structure, if successful; otherwise, a pointer to NULL

.SS "struct \fBgraph_t\fP * initGraph (enum \fBGRAPHDOMAIN\fP typeflags, size_t lblcount, struct \fBdimensions_t\fP * dims)"

.PP
Initialize a graph according to the flags set in the GRAPHDOMAIN value\&. Using the flags set in the typeflags parameter, create a graph structure capable of supporting the requirements in an efficient (memory or Big-O) manner\&.
.PP
The parameter gtype holds the flags for what graph is desired\&. For example, For a directed graph, used to represent a set of cartesian coordinates and no extra label nodes, pass in the value created by DIRECTED | LINKED | SPATIAL | UNLABELED\&.
.PP
If an empty set of flags are passed to the typeflags parameter, the returned graph will be UNDIRECTED | LINKED | GENERIC | UNLABELED\&.
.PP
\fBParameters\fP
.RS 4
\fIgtype\fP Type of graph implementation to be created\&. Flag values set underlying structures and metadata\&. 
.br
\fIlblcount\fP Number of label nodes to be used within the graph\&. Required for LABELED flag; ignored for all others\&. 
.br
\fIdims\fP Dimensional parameters structure\&. Required for ARRAY graphs; otherwise, may be NULL\&. The returned graph will hold the reference to the structure that was passed\&. 
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
If successful and valied, initialized graph structure, according to the flags\&. Otherwise, a NULL pointer\&.
