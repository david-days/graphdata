.PP
Operations for a linked-list graph structure\&. Function pointer definition for getting the node count;\&.
.PP
This implementation is for a linked-list graph structure that uses the minimum necessary memory to store vertex and edge data for a graph\&. The intent is to support the most general graph usage, wherein the user of the graph structure may not be able to determine exact relationship before graph creation\&.
.PP
In this first version, the operations are implemented around a double-linked list structure, with node and edge walking as necessary to find the appropriate relationships\&. Future versions will attempt to add more nuanced and intelligent layouts in order to speed up operations\&.
