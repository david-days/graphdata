# graphData
This is the C project that provides basic graph manipulation for other processes.

# Project Structure
This is a CMake project that is intended to be able to either cross-compile or build native libraries on various platforms.  As
such, a lot of effort has been put into separating platform-specific requirements from basic C++ build and test requirements.

The C project's overall structure is as follows:
```

# Build
Platform-specific options, settings, and code is typically named or located to indicate the target platform.  Wherever these
settings are mixed in, comments and buildtime/runtime checks are included.

## Build/Package/Install
The general setup and build files are described here.

* `🏗️ buildLinux.sh` This is the build script for Linux.  Simply run it with `./buildLinux.sh -h` to see all options.
* `🏗️ BuildLib.ps1` This is the cross-platform build script.  Simply run it with `./BuildLib.ps1 -help` to see all options.
* `🔧 linux-x64.cmake`  CMake build and install settings for Linux.  Make os-specific changes here, if possible
* `🔧 osx.cmake`  CMake build and install settings for OSX.  Make os-specific changes here, if possible
* `🔧 win-x64.cmake`  CMake build and install settings for Windows.  Make os-specific changes here, if possible
* `📂 build-linux-x64` Created by the build script.  When the built on a Linux machine, the intermediate products and settings (including all the relevant Makefile output)
  will be placed under this folder.
* `📂 build-osx` Created by the build script.  When the built on an OSX machine, the intermediate products and settings (including all the relevant Makefile output)
  will be placed under this folder.
* `📂 build-win-x64` Created by the build script.  When the built on a Windows machine, the intermediate products and settings (including all the relevant Makefile output)
  will be placed under this folder.
* `📂 output` Created by build script.  Final output products (binaries, optional CPack packages, etc.) are placed here. 

# Testing
See the file [Test.md](tests/Testing.md) for specifics.

# Contribute
* Build this project on various platforms and make adjustments to the targeted build process
* Add build setup for Mac/OSX
* Add platform-specific installation and packaging (.deb, .rpm, .msi, etc.)
* Convert to a C++ testing platform
