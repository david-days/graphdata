/**
 * @brief Initialize a graph according to the flags set in the GRAPHDOMAIN value.
 *
 * Using the flags set in the typeflags parameter, create a graph structure capable of supporting the requirements in an
 * efficient (memory or Big-O) manner.
 *
 * The parameter gtype holds the flags for what graph is desired.  For example, For a directed graph, used to represent a set of cartesian
 * coordinates and no extra label nodes, pass in the value created by DIRECTED | LINKED | SPATIAL | UNLABELED.
 *
 * If an empty set of flags are passed to the typeflags parameter, the returned graph will be UNDIRECTED | LINKED | GENERIC | UNLABELED.
 *
 * @param gtype Type of graph implementation to be created. Flag values set underlying structures and metadata.
 * @param lblcount Number of label nodes to be used within the graph.  Required for LABELED flag; ignored for all others.
 * @param dims Dimensional parameters structure.  Required for ARRAY graphs; otherwise, may be NULL.  The returned graph will
 * hold the reference to the structure that was passed.
 * @return If successful and valied, initialized graph structure, according to the flags.  Otherwise, a NULL pointer.
