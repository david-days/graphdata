/**
 * @brief Array implementation of the graph structure for fixed-size, fixed-degree, UNDIRECTED graphs.
 *
 * The array implementation of the graph structure is based on an UNDIRECTED, fixed-size and
 * fixed maximum degree for the nodes.
 *
 * Because the graph is UNDIRECTED, the start of each edge will actually be minNode(u,v) and the
 * end of each edge will be maxNode(u,v).  Thus, node 0 can connect "upwards", but no higher nodes
 * can connect down to node 0.  In all the underlying operations, having 0 in a node reference value
 * indicates an unused edge reference.
